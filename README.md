# TFX-Data-Validation
Based on the Coursera MLOps sepcialization course

Tensorflow Data Validation (TFDV) is an open-source library that helps to understand, validate, and monitor production machine learning (ML) data at scale. Common use-cases include comparing training, evaluation and serving datasets, as well as checking for training/serving skew.

In this task, I use TFDV in order to:

    1. Generate and visualize statistics from a dataframe
    2. Infer a dataset schema
    3. Calculate, visualize and fix anomalies
